What to do now:

Delete your last message immediately.

Regenerate your API Key: The best practice after a key is exposed is to delete it and create a new one.

Go to the Google Cloud Console Credentials page.

Make sure your collego-pedia project is selected at the top.

You will see a list of API keys. Find the one that you just posted (it will be named something like "Browser key (auto created by Firebase)").

Click the trash can icon to delete it.

Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS" at the top, select "API key", and a new one will be generated.

Copy this new key and use it in your .env.local file.

This is a critical lesson in web development: Never, ever share the contents of your .env or any other file with secret keys publicly.Error generating content.
